## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Options to better control the rotation filter (#60 and #67):
  - invert_bottom: bottom angles are inverted.
  - skip_top: top components aren't rotated.
  - skip_bottom: bottom components aren't rotated.
- XLSX BoM: option to control the logo scale (#84)
- Import mechanism for filters and variants (#88)
- PDF PCB Print: option `hide_excluded` to hide components marked by the
  `exclude_filter`.
  https://forum.kicad.info/t/fab-drawing-for-only-through-hole-parts/
- Internal BoM: option to avoid merging components with empty fields.
  Is named `merge_both_blank` and defaults to true.
- Internal BoM: when a `Value` field can't be interpreted as a `number+unit`,
  and it contain at least one space, now we try to use the text before the
  space. This helps for cases like "10K 1%".
- Generic filter: options to match if a field is/isn't defined.
- Excellon drill: added `route_mode_for_oval_holes` option.
- Default global `dir` option.
- Pattern to expand the variant name: %V
- PCB PDF Print: mechanism to change the block title. (#102)
- 3D view render

### Changed
- Internal BoM: now components with different Tolerance, Voltage, Current
  and/or Power fields aren't grouped together.
  These fields are now part of the default `group_fields`. (#79)
- JLCPCB example, to match current recommendations
  (g200kg/kicad-gerberzipper#11)
- Internal BoM: the field used for variants doesn't produce conflicts. (#100)

### Fixed
- Position files now defaults to use the auxiliar origin as KiCad.
  Can be disabled to use absolute coordinates. (#87)
- Board View: flipped output. (#89)
- Board View: problems with netnames using spaces. (#90)
- Schematic load: problems with fields containing double quotes. (#98)
- `--list`: problems with layers and fields specific for the project.
  (INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog#4)
- Makefile: %VALUE not expanded in the directory targets.
- KiCost variants: empty DNF fields shouldn't be excluded. (#101)
- KiCost variants: problems when setting a field in a variant that doesn't
  exist when no variant is selected. (#105)
- PCB Print: to show the real name of the PCB file. (#102)
- Compress: not expanding %VALUES in target dirs. (#111)

- Pattern expansion in the `dir` option for outputs (#58)
- New filter types:
  - `suparts`: Adds support for KiCost's subparts feature.
  - `field_rename`: Used to rename schematic fields.
  - `var_rename_kicost`: Like `var_rename` but using KiCost mechanism.
- New KiCost variant style.

- Makefile variables KIBOT, DEBUG and LOGFILE can be defined from outside.
- Reference ranges of two elements no longer represented as ranges.
  Examples: "R1-R2" is now "R1 R2", "R1-R3" remains unchanged.

### Fixed

- Not all errors during makefile generation were catched (got a stack trace).
- Output dirs created when generating a makefile for a compress target.
- Problems with some SnapEDA libs (extra space in lib termination tag #57)
- The "References" (plural) column is now coloured as "Reference" (singular)

## [0.10.1] - 2021-02-22
### Added
- GitLab CI workaround
- Verbosity level is now passed to KiAuto

## [0.10.0-4] - 2021-02-16

## [0.10.0-3] - 2021-02-16
### Fixed
- Problem using Python 3.6 (StreamHandler.setStream introduced in 3.7)

## [0.10.0-2] - 2021-02-12
### Fixed
- Missing python3-distutils dependency on Debian package.

## [0.10.0] - 2021-02-12
### Added
- The multipart id to references of multipart components others than part 1.
- Internal BoM:
  - `no_conflict` option to exclude fields from conflict detection.
  - HTML tables can be sorted selecting a column (Java Script).
  - You can consolidate more than one project in one BoM.
- Support for KICAD_CONFIG_HOME defined from inside KiCad.
- Now layers can be selected using the default KiCad names.
- More control over the name of the drill and gerber files.
- More options to customize the excellon output.
- Custom reports for plot outputs (i.e. custom gerber job generation)
- Example configurations for gerber and drill files for:
  - [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/)
  - [FusionPCB](https://www.seeedstudio.io/fusion.html)
  - [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
  - [P-Ban](https://www.p-ban.com/)
  - [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com)
- Support for ZIP/TAR/RAR generation.

- KiAuto time-out control.
- Now you can import outputs from another config file.

### Changed
- Now the default output name applies to the DRC and ERC report names.
  This provides more coherent file names.
- Internal BoM: The "Quantity" column no longer includes the DNF/C status.
  This status was moved to a separated column named `Status`.
  You can join both columns if you want.
- Internal BoM: HTML rows are highlighted on hover (not just the cell).
- Now information messages go to stdout (not stderr).
  Debug, warning and error messages still use stderr.
- Now InteractiveHtmlBom can be installed just as a plugin.

- The step output now can download missing 3D models.

### Changed
- Now position files are naturally sorted (R10 after R9, not after R1)
- Position files in CSV format quotes only the columns that could contain an
  space. Just like KiCad does.

### Fixed
- Now we support missing field names in schematic library entries.
- Generic filter `include_only` option worked only when debug enabled.

## [0.8.1] - 2020-12-09
### Added
- Internal BoM HTML: highlight cell when hover.
- Internal BoM HTML: allow to jump to REF of row number using anchors.

  separator used for the list of references.
- Help for filters and variants.
- Support for new `pcbnew_do export` options.
- Filters for KiBot warnings.
- Columns in position files can be selected, renamed and sorted as you
  like.

### Fixed
- KiBom variants when using multiple variants and a component uses more
  than one, specifying opposite rules.
- Problems when using the `pdf_pcb_print` output and variants to remove
  a component with ridiculous pads that only has solder paste (no
  copper, nor even solder mask aperture).
- Excellon drill output when using unified output and not using default
  KiCad names.


## [0.7.0] - 2020-09-11
### Added
- Now variants are separated entities. Two flavors implemented: KiBoM
  and IBoM.
- New filters entities. They work in complement with variants.
  All the filtering functionality found in KiBoM and IBoM is supported.
- Most outputs now supports variants. You can:
  - Mark not fitted components with a cross in the schematic
  - Mark not fitted components with a cross in the *.Fab layers of the
    PCB
  - Remove solder paste from not fitted components
  - Remove adhesive glue from not fitted components
  - Exclude components from the BoM (also mark them as DNF and/or DNC
    (Do Not Change))
  - Exclude components from the interactive BoM
  - Remove not fitted components from the STEP file
  - Exclude components from the position (pick & place) file
- Default output file name format and default variant can be specified
  from the command line.

### Fixed
- Virtual components are always excluded from position files.
  Note you can change it using the variants mechanism.

## [0.6.2] - 2020-08-25
### Changed
- Discarded spaces at the beggining and end of user fields when creating the
  internal BoM. They are ususally mistakes that prevents grouping components.

### Fixed
- The variants logic for BoMs when a component resquested to be only added to
  more than one variant.
- Removed warnings about malformed values for DNF components indicating it in
  its value.
- Problems with PcbDraw when generating PNG and JPG outputs. Now we use a more
  reliable conversion methode when available.

### Added
- More robust behavior on GUI dependent commands.

### Changed
- Incorporated mcpy, no longer a dependency.

  At least for user level install.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-08-18
### Added

  and XML traditional outputs.
- Support for full KiBoM configuration from the YAML
- Added output to print to an SVG file.
- Added default output file name pattern. Can be applied to all outputs.

  - `drill`, `drill.map` and `position` file names can be configured.
  - Output file names supports expansion of various interesting values (base
    name, sheet title, revision, etc.).
- The filters now accept the following aliases (suggested by @leoheck):
  - `filter_msg` -> `filter`
  - `error_number` -> `number`
  - `regexp` -> `regex`

### Changed
- Default file names for:
  - pdf_pcb_print: includes the used layers
